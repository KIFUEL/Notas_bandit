## Objetivo
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b28b6021d6040b086c2226ebeb913bc2/warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...
## Hints
- This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.
- To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b28b6021d6040b086c2226ebeb913bc2/warm`
- Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ ./warm`, but you'll first have to make it executable with `$ chmod +x warm`
- h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!
- Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.

## Solución

```
kifuel@DESKTOP-3C07MOG:/mnt/c/Users/Miguel Angel/Downloads$ strings warm | grep pico
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
